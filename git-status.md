# Definition: git status

Command "git status" is an useful command that we can use in Git to check the current status of our local repository. It often provides us information such as which file has been changed, staged, untracked, etc. It helps us to keep tracking on what changes we've made in which order.

Alternatively, we can utilize the JupyterLab IDE rather than the Terminal. If this is our preferred option, we can navigate to the "Git" icon located on the left side of the screen. By clicking on it, we'll access a page where we can view "Changes" and "History" categories. From there, selecting the "Changes" category will reveal drop-down sections such as "Staged," "Changed," and "Untracked." These sections aid in organizing and tracking the changes we've made in a structured manner.
